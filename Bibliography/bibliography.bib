    abstract = { A simple ALGOL-like language is defined which includes conditional, while, and procedure call statements as well as blocks. A formal interpretive semantics and a Hoare style axiom system are given for the language. The axiom system is proved to be sound, and in a certain sense complete, relative to the interpretive semantics. The main new results are the completeness theorem, and a careful treatment of the procedure call rules for procedures with global variables in their declarations. }

  Why3 clearly separates the purely logical

  This article focuses on the former part.
  Why3 comes with a new enhanced language of
  logical specification. It features a rich library of
  proof task transformations that can be chained to produce a suitable
  input for a large set of theorem provers, including SMT solvers,
  TPTP provers, as well as interactive proof assistants.}
