    abstract = { A simple ALGOL-like language is defined which includes conditional, while, and procedure call statements as well as blocks. A formal interpretive semantics and a Hoare style axiom system are given for the language. The axiom system is proved to be sound, and in a certain sense complete, relative to the interpretive semantics. The main new results are the completeness theorem, and a careful treatment of the procedure call rules for procedures with global variables in their declarations. }

  Why3 clearly separates the purely logical

  Why3 comes with a new enhanced language of
  logical specification. It features a rich library of
  proof task transformations that can be chained to produce a suitable
  input for a large set of theorem provers, including SMT solvers,
  TPTP provers, as well as interactive proof assistants.}

This chapter describes Kurt Gödel's paper on the incompleteness theorems. Gödel's incompleteness results are two of the most fundamental and important contributions to logic and the foundations of mathematics. It had been assumed that first-order number theory is complete in the sense that any sentence in the language of number theory would be either provable from the axioms or refutable. Gödel's first incompleteness theorem showed that this assumption was false: it states that there are sentences of number theory that are neither provable nor refutable. The first theorem is general in the sense that it applies to any axiomatic theory, which is ω-consistent, has an effective proof procedure, and is strong enough to represent basic arithmetic. Their importance lies in their generality: although proved specifically for extensions of system, the method Gödel used is applicable in a wide variety of circumstances. Gödel's results had a profound influence on the further development of the foundations of mathematics. It pointed the way to a reconceptualization of the view of axiomatic foundations.}

abstract="Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) refers to the problem of determining whether a first-order formula is satisfiable with respect to some logical theory. Solvers based on SMT are used as back-end engines in model-checking applications such as bounded, interpolation-based, and predicate-abstraction-based model checking. After a brief illustration of these uses, we survey the predominant techniques for solving SMT problems with an emphasis on the lazy approach, in which a propositional satisfiability (SAT) solver is combined with one or more theory solvers. We discuss the architecture of a lazy SMT solver, give examples of theory solvers, show how to combine such solvers modularly, and mention several extensions of the lazy approach. We also briefly describe the eager approach in which the SMT problem is reduced to a SAT problem. Finally, we discuss how the basic framework for determining satisfiability can be extended with additional functionality such as producing models, proofs, unsatisfiable cores, and interpolants.",

We introduce a distinction between informative and non-informative propositions. This distinction allows the removal of the “logical” part in the development of a program. We show also how to use our notion of realizability in order to interpret various axioms like the axiom of choice or the induction on integers. A practical example of development of program is given in the appendix.},
