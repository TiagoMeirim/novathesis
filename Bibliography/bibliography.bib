    abstract = { A simple ALGOL-like language is defined which includes conditional, while, and procedure call statements as well as blocks. A formal interpretive semantics and a Hoare style axiom system are given for the language. The axiom system is proved to be sound, and in a certain sense complete, relative to the interpretive semantics. The main new results are the completeness theorem, and a careful treatment of the procedure call rules for procedures with global variables in their declarations. }
